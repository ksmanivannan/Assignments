    <h2>Italian</h2>
    <p>Significant changes occurred with the discovery of the New World and the introduction of potatoes,
        tomatoes, bell peppers and maize, now central to the cuisine but not introduced in quantity until the 18th century.</p>
    <p>Italian cuisine is characterized by its simplicity, with many dishes having only four to eight ingredients.[9]
        Italian cooks rely chiefly on the quality of the ingredients rather than on elaborate preparation
        Italian cuisine has developed over the centuries. Although the country known as Italy did not unite until the 19th century,
        the cuisine can claim traceable roots as far back as the 4th century BCE. Through the centuries, neighbouring regions, conquerors,
        high-profile chefs, political upheaval and the discovery of the New World have influenced its development. Italian food started to
        form after the fall of the Roman Empire, when different cities began to separate and form their own traditions. Many different
        types of bread and pasta were made, and there was a variation in cooking techniques and preparation. The country was split.
        For example the North of Italy (Milan) is known for its risottos, the central/middle of the country (Bologna) is known for its
        tortellini and the South (Naples) is famous for its pizzas.</p>

    <p>In the 15th century, Maestro Martino was chef to the Patriarch of Aquileia at the Vatican. His Libro de arte coquinaria describes a
        more refined and elegant cuisine. His book contains a recipe for Maccaroni Siciliani, made by wrapping dough around a thin iron rod to
        dry in the sun. The macaroni was cooked in capon stock flavored with saffron, displaying Persian influences. Of particular note is Martino's
        avoidance of excessive spices in favor of fresh herbs.[12] The Roman recipes include coppiette (air-dried salami) and cabbage dishes.
        His Florentine dishes include eggs with Bolognese torta, Sienese torta and Genoese recipes such as piperata (sweets), macaroni, squash,
        mushrooms, and spinach pie with onions.[16]

        Martino's text was included in a 1475 book by Bartolomeo Platina printed in Venice entitled De honesta voluptate et valetudine
        ("On Honest Pleasure and Good Health"). Platina puts Martino's "Libro" in regional context, writing about perch from Lake Maggiore,
        sardines from Lake Garda, grayling from Adda, hens from Padua, olives from Bologna and Piceno, turbot from Ravenna, rudd from Lake
        Trasimeno, carrots from Viterbo, bass from the Tiber, roviglioni and shad from Lake Albano, snails from Rieti, figs from Tuscolo, grapes
        from Narni, oil from Cassino, oranges from Naples and eels from Campania. Grains from Lombardy and Campania are mentioned as is honey from
        Sicily and Taranto. Wine from the Ligurian coast,
        Greco from Tuscany and San Severino and Trebbiano from Tuscany and Piceno are also in the book.[17]</p>

    <h2>Indian</h2>
    <p>Indian cuisine encompasses a wide variety of regional cuisines native to India. Given the range of diversity in soil type,
        climate, culture, ethnic group and occupations, these cuisines vary significantly from each other and use locally available spices, herbs, vegetables and fruits</p>
    <p>Historical incidents such as foreign invasions, trade relations and colonialism have also played a role in introducing certain foods to the country.
        During the Middle Ages, several Indian dynasties were predominant, including the Gupta dynasty. Travellers to India during this time introduced new cooking methods
        and products to the region, including tea. India was later invaded by tribes from Central Asian cultures, which led to the emergence of Mughlai cuisine, a mix of Indian and Central
        Asian cuisine. Hallmarks include seasonings such as saffron
        Assamese cuisine is a mixture of different indigenous styles, with considerable regional variation and some external influences. Although it is known for its limited use of spices,[33]
        Assamese cuisine has strong flavours from its use of endemic herbs, fruits, and vegetables served fresh, dried or fermented. Fish is widely eaten. Other Non-vegetarian items include chickens,
        ducks, pigeons, snails, silkworms, insects, mutton, pork, venison and turtle. The region's cuisine involves simple cooking processes, mostly barbecuing, steaming, boiling or fermenting. Bhuna,
        the gentle frying of spices before the addition of the main ingredients, generally common in Indian cooking, is absent in the cuisine of Assam. A traditional meal in Assam begins with a khar, a
        class of dishes named after the main ingredient and ends with a tenga, a sour dish. As one goes through an Assamese meal, one is taken through a range of pH, starting from alkaline (khar) and ending in acidic (tenga).
        Homebrewed rice beer or rice wine is served before a meal. The food is usually served in bell metal utensils.[34] Paan, the practice of chewing betel nut, generally concludes a meal.</p>

        <p>Tamil Nadu is noted for its deep belief that serving food to others is a service to humanity, as is common in many regions of India. The region has a rich cuisine involving both traditional non-vegetarian and
            vegetarian dishes. Tamil food is characterised by its use of rice, legumes, and lentils, along with distinct aromas and flavours achieved by the blending of spices such as curry leaves, tamarind, coriander, ginger,
            garlic, chili pepper, cinnamon, clove, cardamom, cumin, nutmeg, coconut and rose water. The traditional way of eating a meal involves being seated on the floor, having the food served on a banana leaf, and using
            clean fingers of the right hand to transfer the food to the mouth. After the meal, the fingers are washed, and the banana leaf becomes food for cows. A meal (called Saapadu) consists of rice with other typical Tamil
            dishes on a banana leaf. A typical Tamilian would eat in banana leaf as it gives different flavour and taste to the food. But it can also be served on a stainless steel tray - plate with a selection of different dishes
            in small bowls. Tamil food is characterised by tiffins, which is a light food taken for breakfast or dinner, and meals which are usually taken during lunch. The word "curry" is derived from the Tamil kari, meaning something similar to "sauce".[100][101]
            The southern regions such as Tirunelveli, Madurai, Paramakudi, Karaikudi, and Chettinad are noted for their spicy non-vegetarian dishes.[102][103] Dosa, idli and pongal are some of the popular dishes and are eaten with chutney and sambar.
            Fish and other seafoods are also very popular, because the state is located on the coast.</p>
