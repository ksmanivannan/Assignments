    <h2>Italian</h2>
    <p>Significant changes occurred with the discovery of the New World and the introduction of potatoes,
        tomatoes, bell peppers and maize, now central to the cuisine but not introduced in quantity until the 18th century.</p>
    <p>Italian cuisine is characterized by its simplicity, with many dishes having only four to eight ingredients.[9]
        Italian cooks rely chiefly on the quality of the ingredients rather than on elaborate preparation</p>
</div>
<div id="section2">
    <h2>Indian</h2>
    <p>Indian cuisine encompasses a wide variety of regional cuisines native to India. Given the range of diversity in soil type,
        climate, culture, ethnic group and occupations, these cuisines vary significantly from each other and use locally available spices, herbs, vegetables and fruits</p>
    <p>Historical incidents such as foreign invasions, trade relations and colonialism have also played a role in introducing certain foods to the country.</p>
</div>
<div id="section3">
